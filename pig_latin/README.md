This exercise is tricky and was removed from our recommendations because it mostly leverages regular expressions for the solution, and those aren't really taught at this point in our curriculum.

Leaving it here for posterity, or a good challenge for anyone that wants to give it a shot.

Pig Latin is a children's language that is intended to be confusing when spoken quickly. Your job for this exercise is to create a solution that takes the words given and
turns them into pig latin. Please see the following wikipedia page for details regarding the rules of Pig Latin:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin

The rules section will give the rules and the examples that are required to complete this exercise.

For words that begin with consonant sounds, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence. Then, "ay" is added, as in the following examples:[12]

    "pig" = "igpay"
    "latin" = "atinlay"
    "banana" = "ananabay"
    "happy" = "appyhay"
    "duck" = "uckday"
    "me" = "emay"
    "too" = "ootay"
    ”bagel” = “agelbay”

When words begin with consonant clusters (multiple consonants that form one sound), the whole sound is added to the end when speaking or writing.[13]

    "smile" = "ilesmay"
    "string" = "ingstray"
    "stupid" = "upidstay"
    "glove" = "oveglay"
    "trash" = "ashtray"
    "floor"= "oorflay"
    "store"= "orestay"

For words that begin with vowel sounds, one just adds "way" or "yay" to the end (or just "ay"). Examples are:

    "eat" = "eatway" or "eatay"
    "omelet" = "omeletway" or "omeletay"
    "are" = "areway" or "areay"
    "egg" = "eggway" or "eggay"
    "explain" = "explainway"
    "always" = "alwaysway" or "alwaysay"
    "ends" = "endsway" or "endsay"
    "honest" = "honestway"
    "I"= "Iway"

An alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, one removes the initial vowel(s) along with the first consonant or consonant cluster.[citation needed] This usually only works for words with more than one syllable and offers a variant of the words in keeping with the mysterious, unrecognizable sounds of the converted words. Examples are:

    "every" = "eryevay"
    "another" = "otheranay"
    "under" = "erunday"
    "island" = "andislay"
    "elegant" = "egantelay"

Sentence structure remains the same as it would in English. Pronunciation of some words may be a little difficult for beginners, but people can easily understand Pig Latin with practice.
